This is really simple example of using GraphQL on NodeJS application.

## Installing
- git clone from repository
- install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
- start server
```sh
npm run start
```
- access on browser
```
http://localhost:4000/graphql
```

You can see the GraphQL console. On top left right you see the "Docs" menu.
